              <p >An orange glow radiates from the centre of NGC 1792, the heart of this stellar forge. Captured by the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope. The vast swathes of tell-tale blue seen throughout the galaxy indicate areas that are full of young, hot stars, and it is in the shades of orange, seen nearer the centre, that the older, cooler stars reside.

              <p>Chosen by: Jason Kalirai, project scientist, James Webb Space Telescope, Space Telescope Science Institute “The Butterfly Nebula shows what happens to a star at the end of its life, when it loses all of its gas and dust to its surroundings. Not only is this a reminder to the eventual fate of our own Sun and Solar System, but Hubble's unique ability to witness this event in a star's long life cycle sheds light on how stars evolve

              <p>Chosen by: Melissa McGrath, astronomer, Marshall Space Flight Center “One of the most iconic images, at least for Solar System observations, ever made with Hubble is this view of the northern polar aurora of Jupiter. You can see footprint emissions from the satellites Io, Ganymede and Europa.”
